# Mendelian-Randomisation-project

My research project as part of the MSc Bioinformatics programme.

**Aim:** To understand the causal impact of Basal Metabolic Index, Coronary Artery Disease, Systolic Blood Pressure, C-Reactive Protein, Heart Failure, and Left Atrial volume on the risk of developing Atrial Fibrillation.

**Univariable Mendelian Randomisation:**

**Statistical methods to estimate causal inference:**
- MR-Egger
- Weighted Median
- Inverse Variance Weighted
- Simple Mode
- Weighted Mode

**Sensitivity analyses:**
- Q- statistics to assess Heterogeneity 
- Egger intercept to assess Pleiotropy
